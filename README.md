# 🚀 Algorithm Journey

Welcome to my algorithmic problem-solving journey! 
This repository contains my solutions to problems from HackerRank, LeetCode and other platforms organized by topic and difficulty.

## 🎯 Goals
- Consistently improve problem solving skills.
- Master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).
- Prepare for technical interviews.

## 📂 Repository Structure

I follow a structured approach to organize my code:
